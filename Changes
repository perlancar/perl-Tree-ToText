Revision history for Tree-ToText

0.03    2016-03-31 (PERLANCAR)

	- Tweak output format: class name is now shown at the front using
          "(NAME) ", by default 'show_class_name' is now turned off. Attribute
          value rendering is now more sophisticated, using Data::Dmp to show
          unsafe values.

        - Try hash key when accessor/getter method for an attribute does not
          exist. When that fail too, use undef instead of dying.

        - Add option 'on_show_node' to completely customize node rendering.

0.01    2016-03-27 (PERLANCAR)
